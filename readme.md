# Transfer Learning in Semantic Segmentation

## Overview
This project investigates the application of transfer learning to semantic segmentation in autonomous driving, focusing on the detection of cars and traffic signs. By leveraging a pre-trained DeepLabv3+ model and fine-tuning it on the JHUStreet dataset, we aim to address the challenges posed by domain differences and enhance object recognition accuracy in urban environments.

## Objectives
- Adapt the DeepLabv3+ model to improve segmentation accuracy on the JHUStreet dataset.
- Evaluate the impact of transfer learning on semantic segmentation performance under domain shifts.

## Methodology
- Utilized the DeepLabv3+ model, pre-trained on Cityscapes.
- Fine-tuned the model on the JHUStreet dataset, collected around Johns Hopkins University.
- Employed data augmentation techniques to enhance model training.

## Results
- Demonstrated improved segmentation accuracy for cars and traffic signs.
- Highlighted the effectiveness of transfer learning in overcoming domain discrepancies.
